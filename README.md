## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

GQPaymentIOSSDK is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'GQPaymentIOSSDK', '~> 1.3.13'
```


# Initialising:

Import the SDK on your viewcontroller, where you want to present the payment screen.

```ruby
import GQPaymentIOSSDK
```


Intialise the GQPaymentSDK class.

    let gqPaymentSDK = GQPaymentSDK()

    gqPaymentSDK.modalPresentationStyle = .overFullScreen
    gqPaymentSDK.modalTransitionStyle = .crossDissolve

    gqPaymentSDK.delegate = self
    gqPaymentSDK.clientJSONObject = <Your ClientJSONObject>
    gqPaymentSDK.prefillJSONObject = <Your PrefillJSONObject>
    
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.present(gqPaymentSDK, animated: true)
    }


# Add the following code for Delegates/ Callbacks:

Confirm your Viewcontroller to the GQPaymentDelegate protocol:

    extension ViewController: GQPaymentDelegate {
    
    
Use these methods to receive Success, Failure and Cancel response.

    func gqSuccessResponse(data: [String : Any]?) {
        print("Success callback received with data: \(data)")
    }

    func gqFailureResponse(data: [String : Any]?) {
        print("Failure callback received with data: \(data)")
